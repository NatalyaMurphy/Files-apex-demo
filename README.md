# Files-apex-demo
The main usefulness of this repo is to show different ways to manipulate files (aka ContentDocument, ContentVersion, ContentDocumentLink records) in Salesforce.
The LWC is embarrassingly ugly but does the job of allowing you to invoke the various Apex methods.

And of course, always remember to check CRUD/FLS and sharing access before using this code in production.

The fastest way to use the LWC is to add it to an existing Account flexipage, or just make the flexipage in this repo the default record page for Account for your org, app or a profile.
